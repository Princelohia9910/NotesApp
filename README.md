# NotesApp üìù

A simple, modern, and performant notes application for Android, built entirely in Kotlin. This app provides a clean Material Design interface for creating, managing, and accessing your notes offline.

This project serves as a practical example of modern Android development architecture and best practices, making it an excellent reference for anyone learning Jetpack, MVVM, and Coroutines.

### Current Features

  - ‚úÖ **Create, Read, Update & Delete (CRUD):** Full support for note management.
  - ‚úÖ **Persistent Local Storage:** Uses Room database to ensure your notes are always available offline.
  - ‚úÖ **Clean UI:** A minimal and intuitive interface built with Material Design 3.
  - ‚úÖ **Light/Dark Theme:** Automatically adapts to your system's theme.
  - ‚úÖ **Search:** Quickly find notes by title or content.
  - ‚úÖ **Share Notes:** Easily share your notes with other applications.

### Planned Features

## üõ† Tech Stack & Architecture

This project follows modern Android architecture and uses a robust set of libraries from the Jetpack suite.

### Tech Stack

  - **Language:** 100% [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  - **UI:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for declarative UI development.
  - **Architecture:** [MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) + Repository Pattern
  - **Asynchronous Programming:** [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) for managing background threads and data streams.
  - **Dependency Injection:** [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for managing dependencies.
  - **Persistence:** [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local, persistent storage.
  - **Testing:** [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) & [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) / Compose UI Tests.

### Architecture

The app is built upon the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

```
+----------------+      +----------------+      +-----------------+      +----------------+
|      UI        |      |   ViewModel    |      |   Repository    |      |   DataSource   |
| (Composable)   |----->| (Handles UI    |----->|  (Single source |----->|  (Room DB)     |
| (Observes State|      |  logic & State)|      |   of truth)     |      |                |
+----------------+      +----------------+      +-----------------+      +----------------+
```

  - **UI Layer:** Observes state changes from the ViewModel and sends user events.
  - **ViewModel Layer:** Holds and processes UI-related data, exposing it as observable state (using Flow). It is lifecycle-aware and survives configuration changes.
  - **Repository Layer:** Abstracted data operations. It coordinates data from the local data source (Room).
  - **Data Layer:** The single source of truth for the app, managed by the Room persistence library.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  - Android Studio (Iguana or newer recommended)
  - JDK 17
  - Android SDK

### Clone & Run

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
