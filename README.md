# NotesApp

A simple, fast, and modern Android notes app written in Kotlin. Create, edit, and manage your notes with a clean UI and local persistence so your notes are always available offline.

If you're exploring Android development, this project is a solid foundation to learn typical app structure, state management, and persistence.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete notes
- Persistent local storage (e.g., Room or similar)
- Search and sort notes
- Material Design with light/dark theme support
- Share notes with other apps
- Undo/redo support and swipe-to-delete (optional)
- Pin or archive notes (optional)

Planned and nice-to-have:
- Reminders and notifications
- Categories/labels with color tags
- Backup/restore (export/import)
- Biometrics lock (fingerprint/face)

## Tech stack

- Language: Kotlin
- Android: Jetpack/Material
- Architecture: MVVM + Repository
- Persistence: Room (or equivalent local storage)
- Concurrency: Coroutines/Flow
- UI: Views or Jetpack Compose (depending on implementation)
- Dependency Injection: Hilt/Koin (if applicable)
- Testing: JUnit, Espresso/Compose UI tests (if applicable)

Note: The exact libraries may vary based on the current implementation. Adjust this section to reflect what's in build.gradle.

## Getting started

Prerequisites:
- Android Studio (Giraffe or newer recommended)
- JDK 17 (or the version configured in Gradle)
- Android SDK/Platform Tools
- An emulator or a physical Android device

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Princelohia9910/NotesApp.git
cd NotesApp
```

Open in Android Studio:
1. File > Open… and select the project folder.
2. Let Gradle sync finish.
3. Select a device or emulator.
4. Press Run.

Build from the command line:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Run unit tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

Run instrumented tests (if present):
```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Project structure

This project follows a conventional Android structure with clear separation of concerns. A typical layout looks like:

```
app/
 ├─ src/
 │   ├─ main/
 │   │  ├─ java/.../notes/
 │   │  │   ├─ data/        # DAOs, entities, repositories
 │   │  │   ├─ domain/      # Use cases (if applicable)
 │   │  │   └─ ui/          # Activities/Fragments/Compose screens, ViewModels
 │   │  └─ res/             # Layouts, drawables, themes, strings
 │   └─ androidTest/        # UI tests
 │   └─ test/               # Unit tests
 └─ build.gradle
```

Adjust this section to match your actual package structure.

## Architecture

- MVVM: ViewModel exposes UI state; UI observes state and triggers events.
- Repository: Encapsulates data operations and abstracts data sources.
- Local persistence: Room (or similar) as a single source of truth.
- Coroutines/Flow: For asynchronous work and reactive streams.

Benefits:
- Testable, maintainable, and scalable
- Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Easy to introduce new data sources (e.g., remote sync)

## Configuration

The app is self-contained and should run without API keys. For release builds:
- Configure your signing config/keystore in `gradle.properties` or Android Studio
- Update the applicationId, versionCode, and versionName in module `build.gradle`

## Code quality

If you use these tools, document them here and add instructions:
- ktlint or Spotless for Kotlin formatting
- detekt for static analysis

Example:
```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew detekt
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch
- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Add/update tests where appropriate
- Open a pull request with a clear description, screenshots if UI changes, and any relevant context

For larger changes, consider opening a discussion or issue first.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve search (fuzzy, highlight matches)
- [ ] Bulk actions (multi-select)
- [ ] Sorting and grouping enhancements
- [ ] Export/import (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Reminders with notifications
- [ ] Biometrics lock
